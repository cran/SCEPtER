Description: A pipeline for estimating the stellar
        age, mass, and radius given observational 
        effective temperature, [Fe/H], and astroseismic
	parameters. The results are obtained adopting a maximum likelihood
	technique over a grid of pre-computed stellar models, as
	described in Valle et al. (2014) <doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201322210>.
